<h1>Hydra</h1>
<p>This is a simple show and tell for a simple webpage. Note much will go into it but it will be used to do a full scale show and tell. The point is to attempt to kill, overload, tamper with the EC2 that host me. If my backbone is set up I will self heal. May the odds be in my favor MAHAHA.</p>
